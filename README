Welcome to NEW DEAL IRC!

=== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ===

No install at this point, just perl newdeal.pl

Note that you will need some curses libraries installed

At the moment it connects to a hardcoded local server and doesn't show anything
useful since I still don't understand how to manipulate curses properly

=== ABOUT THIS PROJECT ===

The goal of this is, well, first and foremost so I can learn how to use
git and version control, and also so I can learn perl. I can't wait to scrap
everything and go back to the superior python when it drives me nuts.

As for the spirit of the project, I am a fan of irssi, but not a fan of how
you need to memorize a million commands and use miles long cheat sheets to do
what should be simple things. The goal is to make an IRC client that may not
include every bell and whistle for hardcore users, but provides the user hints
and makes use of modern features like 256 color terminals and mouse support
(the former required to run and the latter not required, but nice) via things
like colored user names, popups, and color coding
